## Hello, there

I present you the powerful iOS app **WordGraph**! You can download it from [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/%E8%AF%8D%E8%B0%B1/id1282520024?ls=1&mt=8)

   
### What is Word-Graph

Word-Graph is an interactive English dictionary and thesaurus that helps you find the meanings of words and draw connections to associated words. You can easily see the meaning of each by simply tap it. Here is why you would like it:
   


### How can we make it

The Word-Graph interface queries the WordNet lexical database developed by Princeton University and made available for students and language researchers. This dictionary groups synonyms into synsets through lexical relations between terms. These meanings and semantic relationships are revealed graphically by the interactive technology made available by me :)



### Why use Word-Graph

* Easy to use dictionary and thesaurus.
* Learn how words associate in a visually interactive display.
* Get ideas to help write content for your blog, article, thesis or simply play with words!
* No registration required.
* It’s free and fun!
